## Installation

**ng-logo** libraries can be installed from the **npm, Inc.** with public access. You can see all public packages of Logo Software from https://www.npmjs.com/~logofe. Choose a package which you want then run `npm install @logo/(package_name)` command to install. For example, if you want to install `@logo/core` package:
```bash

$ npm install @logo/core
```
We also hold our libraries in [Nexus Repository Manager](https://dregistry.logo.com.tr/#browse/browse/assets:npm-logofe). First, you must register for these repositories.
