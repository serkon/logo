    <p>
      The breadcrumb is a secondary navigation pattern that helps a user understand the hierarchy among levels and
      navigate back through them.

      <li>Overview</li>
      <li>Demo</li>

  <div class="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Breadcrumbs show users their current location relative to the information architecture and enable them to
      quickly
      move up to a parent level or previous step.
    </p>

    <h3>When to use</h3>
    <p>
      Breadcrumbs are effective in products and experiences that have a large amount of content organized in a
      hierarchy of more than two levels. They take up little space but still provide context for the user’s place in
      the navigation hierarchy which is crucial for the user to not get lost through the app.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="wtnu">
    <h3>When not to use</h3>
    <p>
      Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace the primary navigation. They
      shouldn’t be used for products that have single level navigation because they create unnecessary clutter.

  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <h3>Main elements</h3>
    <h5>Page link</h5>
    <p>
      Each page link should be short and clearly reflect the location or entity it links to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with the highest level parent page and move deeper into the information architecture as the breadcrumb trail
      progresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, the current page is not listed in the breadcrumb trail.
    </p>
    <h3>Overflow content</h3>
    <p>
      When space becomes limited, use an overflow menu to truncate the breadcrumbs. The first and last two page links
      should be shown, but the remaining breadcrumbs in between are condensed into an overflow menu. Breadcrumbs should
      never wrap onto a second line.

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <h3>Interactions</h3>
    <p>
      All the page links in the breadcrumb component should be interactive and link to their respective pages.
    </p>
    <h3>Mouse</h3>
    <p>
      Users can trigger an item by clicking on a breadcrumb page link. The separators between page links are not
      interactive.
    </p>
    <h3>Keyboard</h3>
    <p>
      Users can trigger a breadcrumb link by pressing enter while the link has focus. For additional keyboard
      interactions, see the accessibility tab.
