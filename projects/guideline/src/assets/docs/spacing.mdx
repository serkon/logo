      Spacing is one of the most important principles of design. In order to create accurate and consistent visual
      hierarchies, 2 different spacing scales were defined.

    <h2>Scales</h2>
    <p>
      We have 2 different spacing scales. One is used to determine the hierarchy between the elements of a component and
      the other is used to define spacing between page elements.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Spacing</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Spacing Scale</td>
        <td>
          Used in smaller spaces, more detailed spacing needs, especially within a component. (i.e. the space between
          text inbut and component title)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Layout Scale</td>
        <td>
          It is mainly used when positioning components within the page. (i.e. the space between header and a form
          component)
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

    <h2>Spacing Scale</h2>
    <p>
      It is the scale used in the creation of all components. Small increments are included. Thus, it is possible to
      create high detail components. It is very important to adhere to this scaling for a consistent design.

    <h2>Layout Scale</h2>
    <p>
      This scale is used to create relationships between components in the page or to create hierarchical groups by
      separating components. Increments in this scale are greater than the spacing scale. By using larger scales, white
      space can be created. More dense designs can be created by using smaller scales.
