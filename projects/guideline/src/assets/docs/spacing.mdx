# Spacing

Spacing is one of the most important principles of design. In order to create accurate and consistent visual
hierarchies, 2 different spacing scales were defined.

## Scales

We have 2 different spacing scales. One is used to determine the hierarchy between the elements of a component and the
other is used to define spacing between page elements.
