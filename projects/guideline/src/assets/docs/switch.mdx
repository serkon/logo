    <p>
      Switches are digital on / off switches. It asks users to choose between two different options and always has a
      default value. Transitions should deliver immediate results and give users the freedom to control their
      preferences as needed. Switches are commonly used for “on/off” switches. They should not require the user to click
      Save or Submit after their selection.
