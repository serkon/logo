      Color distinguishes our brand and helps us create consistent experiences across products. The following concepts
      are the foundation as we strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface design.

      Consistent application of the color palette provides an integrated and recognizable experience
      on all platforms. Delicately determined colors for the theme, form the basis of consistency.

    <h2>Interaction States</h2>
    <p>
      The dominant color in our color palette is blue. It has been diversified with neutral and brand
      color palettes in order to create diversity in different areas of use
    </p>
    <h5>
      Hover
    </h5>
    <p>
      Hover states by default take 1 darker step in their palette. Which is 600 of their corresponding color. This has
      exceptions in ghost and outline components.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Active
    </h5>
    <p>
      Active states by default take 2 full darker steps in their palette. Which is 700 of their corresponding color.
      This has exceptions in ghost and outline components.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Focus
    </h5>
    <p>
      Focus states by default take 2 full darker steps in their palette. Which is 700 of their corresponding color. This
      color change is backed by an additional 4 pixel wide blue border.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Disabled
    </h5>
    <p>
      Disabled components are unavailable for interaction, so they donâ€™t receive hover or focus and are not subject to
      WC3 contrast compliance standards. For the dark themes, disabled values are two full steps lighter than their
      respective background. For light themes, they are two full steps darker. The exception is that the White theme
      disabled value is Gray 30.

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      Using various forms of contrast is the most important consideration when making user-friendly color and interface
      choices. Awareness of standards and best practices is the key to accessible color selection.
