  <h2>Overiew</h2>
  <p>
    An accordion menu is a vertically stacked list of headers that can be clicked to reveal or hide content
    associated with them. Accordion allows the display of only one collapsed item at a time.
  </p>
  <div class="wtu">
    <h3>When to use</h3>
    <p>
      It is used to present multiple items, read the entire content or shorten some. When space is vertically limited
      and long content cannot be displayed all at once, like on
      a mobile interface or in a side panel.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="wtnu">
    <h3>When not to use</h3>
    <p>
      If users need to open a lot of the subtopics to reach the information they need or the accordion is not the way
      to go to get the whole story. In this case, it is better to spread the entire content on the page. It is easier
      to scroll down the page than decide which tab to click.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordions are not suitable for situations where the user needs to print the page.
      It is not recommended to use acerdion on pages where this is needed.

  <h2>Content</h2>
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>
    Each title must be wrapped in a role title (h1-h6) appropriate to the information architecture.
    Title should be kept as short as possible.
  </p>
  <h3>Body</h3>
  <p>
    The content under the title can be divided into paragraphs and include subheadings if needed.
  </p>
  <h3>Scrolling Content</h3>
  <p>
    When the accordion content stretches, the entire accordion should scroll vertically. Content should be scrolled
    down in bulk. Content should never scroll horizontally within the accordion.
  </p>
  <h2>Behavior</h2>
  <h3>States</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to the icon to the right of the component, we collapse or expand the content. Accordions start collapsed by
    default and all content panels are closed. Allows users to master all titles while in a collapsed state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also user can expand multiple titles.
  </p>
