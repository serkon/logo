# Button

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:
Dialogs, Forms, Toolbars, etc.

## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user
and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways.
Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

### When to use

Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have
one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

### When not to use

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to
a new page.

## Button Types

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a
new page.

<div class="foo">
  <button class="primary">Primary</button>
  <button class="secondary">Secondary</button>
  <button class="danger">Danger</button>
  <button class="ghost">Ghost</button>
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primary</td>
    <td>For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen
      (not including the application header or in a modal dialog).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Secondary</td>
    <td>For secondary actions on each page; these can only be used in conjunction with a primary button.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tertiary</td>
    <td>For less prominent actions; tertiary buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button
      when there are multiple calls to action.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Danger</td>
    <td>For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data (delete, remove, etc.).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ghost</td>
    <td>For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# Size

Buttons are named according to their size: small, medium and large

<div class="foo">
  <button class="primary small">Button</button>
  <button class="primary medium">Button</button>
  <button class="primary large">Button</button>
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Size</th>
    <th>Usecase</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Small</td>
    <td>24px</td>
    <td>Use when there is not enough vertical space for the medium button.
      Useful cases are small tables and small popovers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>32px</td>
    <td>Use as primary page actions and other standalone actions. This is the default size in web applications.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Large</td>
    <td>48px</td>
    <td>Use when building a form with a single, simple purpose like sign in and sign up forms. This is the default
      size in mobile applications.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Alignment

Alignment refers to whether the buttons are aligned to the right or the left of a window, container,
or layout and the paddings between buttons.

Buttons are aligned with 10 pixel paddings next to each other. Ghost buttons are exceptions.
They are aligned without padding.

## Content

A button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it communicates the action that will be performed
when the user interacts with it. Buttons need to be clear and predictable.

Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. To provide enough context, use the {verb} + {noun}
content formula on buttons except in the case of common actions like “Done”, “Close”, “Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete”.

There are exceptions to this rule for situations in which button length could cause problems
in compact UIs or negatively impact translation, but the {verb} + {noun} formula is still best practice.

## Behaviors

### Interactions

#### Mouse

Users can trigger a button by clicking anywhere within the button container.

#### Keyboard

Users can trigger a button by clicking anywhere within the button container.

## Modifiers

### Icon only buttons

Icon buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap. Mostly used in groups
where a lot of quick actions needs to be accessed in a small layout.
Tooltips appear when the user hovers on an icon only button by default.

<div class="bar">
  <button class="le-bell"></button>
  <button class="le-bell"></button>
  <button class="le-bell"></button>
</div>

### Icon and text buttons

Icons can be placed next to labels to both clarify an action and call attention to a button.

<div class="bar">
  <button class="primary le-bell">Button</button>
  <button class="le-bell">Button</button>
  <button class="ghost le-bell">Button</button>
</div>

### Option buttons

Option buttons reveal a popover when clicked. When an action has more than one options, option buttons can be used.

<div class="bar">
  <button class="primary le-bell">Button</button>
  <button class="le-bell">Button</button>
  <button class="ghost le-bell">Button</button>
</div>
