    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Since forms provide a data export, they must be carefully considered when designing. It should be kept as short as
      possible and the value of each input should be evaluated.

    <h2>Form Logic</h2>
    <h3>Radio buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Radio buttons are used when there is more than one option for users and only one of these options is allowed to
      be selected. Making one choice overrides the other selection previously made.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Checkboxes
    </h5>
    <p>
      Checkboxes are used when there is more than one option and the user can choose between these options as much as
      they want. One choice does not override the previous selection. Single checkboxes or toggles can be used to turn
      an option on or off.
    </p>
    <h5>
      Select elements
    </h5>
    <p>
      Selection elements are used when there is more than one option and only one of these options needs to be selected.

  <div class="valid">
    <h2>Validation and Errors</h2>
    <h3>Error messaging</h3>
    <p>
      With Error messaging, the users can easily recognize where they made an error and how to fix this error. In the
      first step, the user should be told what the error is, and in the second step, the solution.
    </p>
    <h3>Form validaiton</h3>
    <p>
      User data must be validated before being sent via the form. By showing the areas of the problems in the form, the
      user can correct these fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Validation should appear as soon as the user clicks out of the input field. The validation should disappear as
      soon as the user resolves the error in this area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The validation label should be as descriptive as possible.
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/docs_forms_4.png" alt=""/>
    <h3>Optional vs required fields</h3>
    <p>
      All fields in a form are required unless otherwise noted. In such cases, it would be appropriate to show this
      information to the user.
