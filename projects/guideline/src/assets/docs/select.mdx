    <h2>Overview</h2>

      from the options in the list offered. This component is not used instead of the dropdown component.

        <td>Large</td>
        <td>
          The large size select component is used in mobile applications and forms on tablets.

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <h3>Labels</h3>
    <p>
      Select components should be used with a label that will describe the options most accurately.
      Tags allow users to think about what options to choose before taking action.
    </p>
    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <p>
      Validations make the form filling process easier and reduce errors by warning users in a timely manner.
      Check out the form component for more information.
