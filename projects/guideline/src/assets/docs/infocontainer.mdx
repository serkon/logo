    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
    <p>
      Notifications appear next to the items they're linked to. They can expand to fill the width of the container or
      text field they are in, and they must be aligned with the grid columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend placing inline notifications at the bottom of the forms, right above the send and cancel buttons.
