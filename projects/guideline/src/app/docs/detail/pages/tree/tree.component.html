    <h3>Icon</h3>
    <p>
      Tree component icon sizes vary according to the size of the menu itself. In the medium-sized menu, the icons
      should be used in 14x14 pixels, in the large menu they should be used in 30x30 pixels. Icons should be selected
      from the Track Design System icon library.
    </p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>
      In some special cases, images can be used instead of icons. In these cases, the image sizes used are the same as
      the icon sizes. The harmony between the images should be taken into account in the case of image usage.
    </p>
    <h3>Labels</h3>
    <p>
      Labels should be selected in the most accurate way to describe the page to which it will be directed when clicked.
      Labels should not be longer than 4 words if possible.
    </p>
    <h3>Tree levels</h3>
    <p>
      The menu should not be hierarchically divided into more than 4 levels. At level 4, it should be checked that the
      label texts are not truncated.
