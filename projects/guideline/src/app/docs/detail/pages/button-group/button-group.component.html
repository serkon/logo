      If you can not create a breakdown within the data you want to show to the user or if you want to position
      different types of content that are not similar to each other in a single field, use tabs instead of button
      groups.
    </p>
    <h6>Switch</h6>
    <p>
      In cases where you want the user to make a simple "yes" "no" choice, it is better to use the switch component.
