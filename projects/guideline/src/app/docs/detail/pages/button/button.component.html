      Dialogs, Forms, Toolbars, etc.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and
      allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the
      user interacts with it.

    <h3>When to use</h3>
    <p>
      Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should
      have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="wtnu">
    <h3>When not to use</h3>
    <p>
      Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a
      new page.

    <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      Alignment refers to whether the buttons are aligned to the right or the left of a window, container, or layout and
      the paddings between buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buttons are aligned with 10 pixel paddings next to each other. Ghost buttons are exceptions. They are aligned
      without padding.

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
      A button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it communicates the action that will be
      performed when the user interacts with it. Buttons need to be clear and predictable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. To provide enough context, use the "{{ '{' }}
      "verb} + "{{ '{' }}"noun}content formula on buttons except in the case of common actions like “Done”, “Close”,
      “Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete”.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are exceptions to this rule for situations in which button length could cause problems in compact UIs or
      negatively impact translation, but the "{{ '{' }}"verb} + "{{ '{' }}"noun} formula is still best practice.

    <h3>Icon only buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Icon buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap. Mostly used in groups where a lot
      of quick actions needs to be accessed in a small layout. Tooltips appear when the user hovers on an icon only
      button by default.

    <h3>Icon and text buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Icons can be placed next to labels to both clarify an action and call attention to a button.
    </p>
    <div class="demo-base">
      <button class="primary le-bell">Button</button>

    <h3>Icon and text buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Option buttons reveal a popover when clicked. When an action has more than one options, option buttons can be
      used.
