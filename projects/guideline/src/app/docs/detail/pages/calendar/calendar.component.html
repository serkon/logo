    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The calendar shows all time-related data (year, month, week, day, date) at a glance. It also allows users to
      navigate directly from one month or year to another, or to display multiple months.

    <h3>When to use</h3>
    <p>-You want the user to select a single date, multiple days, entire week(s), or a date range.</p>
    <p>-You want to display multiple months at once.</p>
    <p>-The calendar always needs to be visible and prominent.</p>
    <p>
      -Users need to see the year, month, week, weekday and date at a glance to decide which date to select. For
      example, a user might want to select a date based on the day of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      -Users might be used to different locale-specific date formats (such as day-month-year or month-day-year).
      Enabling them to select the date visually using the calendar bypasses format-specific interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>-You want to highlight special days or hide/disable specific days.</p>

    <h3>When not to use</h3>
    <p>-The user is a power user who has to enter a lot of data fast. In this case, use the date picker.</p>
    <p>-The keyboard is the primary input device. In this case, use the date picker.</p>
    <p>-The available screen space is limited and displaying the calendar permanently would take up too much space.</p>
    <p>-The userâ€™s primary goal is to select a date range. In this case, use date range selection.</p>
    <p>-You want to display a range of weekdays in a single row. In this case, use the calendar date interval.</p>
    <p>-The user wants to compare calendars from different people. In this case, use the planning calendar.</p>
    <p>-The user wants to select combined date and time values. In this case, use the date/time picker.</p>
