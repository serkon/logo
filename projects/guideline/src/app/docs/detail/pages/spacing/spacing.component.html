<h1>Spacing</h1>
<p>Spacing is one of the most important principles of design. In order to create accurate and consistent visual
  hierarchies, 2 different spacing scales were defined.</p>
<h2>Scales</h2>
<p>We have 2 different spacing scales. One is used to determine the hierarchy between the elements of a component and
  the
  other is used to define spacing between page elements.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Spacing</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spacing Scale</td>
    <td>
      Used in smaller spaces, more detailed spacing needs, especially within a component.
      (i.e. the space between text inbut and component title)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Layout Scale</td>
    <td>
      It is mainly used when positioning components within the page.
      (i.e. the space between header and a form component)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
